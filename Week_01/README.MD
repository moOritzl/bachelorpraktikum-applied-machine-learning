# Week 01: Data IO, Numpy, and Linear Regression

## Overview

In this lab, we will explore basic data manipulation and analysis techniques using `Pandas` and `Numpy`, followed by the
implementation of a simple linear regression model.
This includes two notebooks, divided into the following tasks:

1. [Pandas and Numpy](./Week_01_Pandas_Numpy.ipynb): Word Count with Python Built-ins and `Pandas` and Matrix Operations
   with `Numpy`
2. [Linear Regression](./Week_01_Linear_Regression.ipynb): Simple Linear Regression

# Bachelorpraktikum: Applied Machine Learning

This repository contains my work for the **Bachelorpraktikum: Applied Machine Learning**. The practical course focuses
on implementing key machine learning algorithms and concepts through a series of labs. The labs cover various data
analysis tasks, model training, and performance evaluation using Python and its essential libraries like Pandas, Numpy,
and Scikit-learn.

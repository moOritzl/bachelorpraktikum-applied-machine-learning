# Bachelorpraktikum: Applied Machine Learning

This repository contains my work for the **Bachelorpraktikum: Applied Machine Learning**. The practical course focuses
on implementing key machine learning algorithms and concepts through a series of labs. The labs cover various data
analysis tasks, model training, and performance evaluation using Python and its essential libraries like Pandas, Numpy,
and Scikit-learn.

## Course Overview

The practical course consists of the following topics:

1. [Week 01](./Week_01): **Introduction and Simple Linear Regression**
    - Overview of machine learning concepts

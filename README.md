# Bachelorpraktikum: Applied Machine Learning

This repository contains my work for the **Bachelorpraktikum: Applied Machine Learning**. The practical course focuses on implementing key machine learning algorithms and concepts through a series of labs. The labs cover various data analysis tasks, model training, and performance evaluation using Python and its essential libraries like Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn.

## Course Overview

The practical course consists of the following topics:
1. [Week 01](./Week_01): **Introduction and Simple Linear Regression**
   - Overview of machine learning concepts
   - Introduction to Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
2. [Week 02](./Week_02): **Linear Regression via Normal Equations**
   - Dataset Exploration
   - Linear Regression using different algorithms for solving the normal equations
3. [Week 02](./Week_02): **Linear Regression via Gradient Descent**
   - Data Preprocessing
   - Linear Regression model via Gradient Descent

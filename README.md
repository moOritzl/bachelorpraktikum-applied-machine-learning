# Bachelorpraktikum: Applied Machine Learning

This repository contains my work for the **Bachelorpraktikum: Applied Machine Learning**. The practical course focuses on implementing key machine learning algorithms and concepts through a series of labs. The labs cover various data analysis tasks, model training, and performance evaluation using Python and its essential libraries like Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn.

## Course Overview

The practical course consists of the following topics:
1. **Introduction to Machine Learning and Python Libraries**
   - Overview of machine learning concepts
   - Introduction to Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
2. **Linear Regression**
   - Simple and multiple linear regression
   - Model evaluation metrics
3. **Classification**
   - Logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - Model evaluation and metrics for classification
4. **Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods**
   - Decision trees, Random forests, Ensemble learning techniques
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - Distance metrics, Choosing optimal K value, Applications in classification and regression
6. **Naive Bayes**
   - Gaussian, Multinomial, and Bernoulli classifiers, Text classification
7. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Clustering fundamentals, Evaluation metrics
8. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
   - Dimensionality reduction, Visualization of principal components
9. **Autoencoders**
   - Unsupervised learning, Anomaly detection
10. **Capstone Project**
    - Integration of techniques, Real-world dataset application

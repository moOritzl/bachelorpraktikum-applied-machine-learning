# Week 02: Dataset Exploration and Linear Regression via Normal Equations

## Overview

In this lab, we focus on two important aspects of data science: exploring datasets and implementing linear regression
using normal equations.

1. [Dataset Exploration](./Dataset_Exploration.ipynb): Dive into the dataset to understand its characteristics using
   descriptive statistics and visualizations. This includes handling missing values, outliers, and other preprocessing
   tasks to prepare the data for modeling.
2. [Linear Regression via Normal Equations](./Linear_Regression_Normal_Equations.ipynb): Implement linear regression
   using three different algorithms: normal equations, gradient descent, and QR descent. The normal equation provides a
   closed-form solution, allowing for directly calculating the optimal parameters for a linear model without requiring
   iterative optimization. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of our linear model using various metrics such as
   Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to understand the accuracy and goodness of fit of our regression model.
